# Pokedex-App

A small web application created as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and jQuery that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

The goal of this project was to learn basic JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, DOM interaction, AJAX, Json etc.) in the second achievement of the course. 

Besides fulfilling the task requirements, I also gave the styling a boost by creating consistent colors and two fonts which match the Pokemon theme.
